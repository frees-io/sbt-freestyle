## How can I help?

Freestyle follows a standard [fork and pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) model for contributions via GitHub pull requests.

The process is simple:

 1. Find something you want to work on
 2. Let us know you are working on it via the Gitter channel or GitHub issues/pull requests
 3. Implement your contribution
 4. Write tests
 5. Update the documentation
 6. Submit pull request

You will be automatically included in the [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md#contributors) file as contributor in the next release.
If you encounter any confusion or frustration during the contribution process, please create a GitHub issue and we'll do our best to improve the process.
